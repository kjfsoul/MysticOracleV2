**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Representing the chat progression)
**Prepared For:** Founders & Advanced AI Assistant
**Prepared By:** Collaborative AI Chat Assistant

**Executive Summary:**

This document details the iterative development process undertaken to create a custom Stable Diffusion LoRA ("MysticArcanaBlacklight") for generating a 78-card tarot deck in a distinct blacklight neon aesthetic. The project successfully navigated initial LoRA training setup errors, trained a functional LoRA, and developed a batch image generation and renaming workflow. Significant progress was made in achieving the desired style for single-figure cards through meticulous prompt engineering and LoRA weight adjustments. However, rendering complex multi-figure cards with both stylistic coherence and compositional clarity remains a key challenge. Technical hurdles, such as VAE issues leading to image static and inefficient CPU-bound upscaling (identified as Hires.fix VRAM limitations), were also diagnosed and addressed. The project is currently at a stage where the core LoRA is functional, a baseline workflow is established, and single-figure cards can be generated to a reasonable quality. The primary strategic decision moving forward revolves around optimizing the generation of multi-figure cards, which may involve further prompt engineering, exploring advanced techniques like ControlNet, considering external generation platforms, or potentially retraining the LoRA with more diverse data.

**I. Project Inception & Initial Goal:**

The primary objective was to train a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) model for Stable Diffusion (specifically SD 1.5) capable of generating tarot card imagery in a vibrant, glowing "blacklight neon" style. The ultimate deliverable is a complete 78-card tarot deck. The user possessed a curated dataset of 21 unique images intended for this style.

**II. Phase 1: LoRA Training â€“ Setup, Troubleshooting, and Success**

* **Initial Training Command & Parameters:**
    The user initiated training with `sd-scripts` using a standard command structure, specifying:
  * `pretrained_model_name_or_path`: `v1-5-pruned-emaonly.safetensors`
  * `train_data_dir`: Path to the dataset.
  * `output_dir` & `output_name`: For the LoRA model.
  * `resolution`: 768x1152 (target tarot card aspect ratio).
  * `network_module`: `networks.lora`
  * `network_dim` & `network_alpha`: 8 (a common starting point for LoRAs).
  * `train_batch_size`: 1
  * `learning_rate`: 1e-4
  * `lr_scheduler`: "cosine_with_restarts"
  * `max_train_steps`: 800
  * `mixed_precision`: fp16
  * `optimizer_type`: AdamW
  * Other common parameters like `xformers`, `gradient_checkpointing`, `shuffle_caption`, `random_crop`.

* **Challenge 1: `AssertionError: image size is small`**
  * **Problem:** The training script failed, indicating that at least one image in the dataset (`MA_Blacklight_TheChariot_v02.png`) was too small for the specified resolution and bucketing parameters, especially in conjunction with `random_crop` which requires images to be larger than the target training resolution.
  * **Solution Exploration:**
        1. **Batch Image Resizing:** Discussed methods for resizing all 21 training images to be at least 768x1152, preferably slightly larger. Tools considered included Canva Pro (Magic Resize), IrfanView, and XnConvert. The user opted for a local resizing solution.
  * **Resolution:** The user resized the images.

* **Challenge 2: `ERROR: No data found` (Incorrect `train_data_dir` structure)**
  * **Problem:** After resizing, the script failed to find training images. This was due to a misunderstanding of the required folder structure for `sd-scripts`. The `--train_data_dir` must point to a parent directory containing subfolders named `<repeats>_<concept_name>` (e.g., `100_lora_training_set`), which in turn hold the images and caption files. The user initially pointed `train_data_dir` directly to the folder containing the images, or one level too deep.
  * **Solution Exploration:** Clarified the expected directory hierarchy. The user was guided to ensure their resized images and `.txt` caption files were inside a correctly named subfolder (e.g., `100_lora_training_set`), and that `--train_data_dir` pointed to the parent of this subfolder.
  * **Resolution:** The user corrected the folder structure.

* **Successful LoRA Training:**
  * With the image size and directory structure issues resolved, the LoRA training (`MysticArcanaBlacklight.safetensors`) completed successfully for 800 steps.
  * Key metadata from the trained LoRA confirmed parameters: `ss_network_dim=8`, `ss_network_alpha=8.0`, `ss_resolution=(768, 1152)`, `ss_num_train_images=2100` (21 unique images * 100 repeats).

**III. Phase 2: Initial LoRA Application & Quality Refinement (Focus on Single Figures)**

The trained LoRA was then tested in AUTOMATIC1111 Web UI.

* **Challenge 3: Initial Generations Overly Busy/Abstract**
  * **Problem:** Early image generations using the LoRA, even with specific prompts, resulted in images that were stylistically "blacklight neon" but overly chaotic, abstract, and lacking clear subject definition. The LoRA's style appeared to dominate, obscuring the intended tarot card concepts.
  * **Solution Exploration & Iteration:**
        1. **Prompt Engineering (Negative Space):** Initial advice focused on modifying prompts to encourage negative space and focus the vibrant elements. This involved:
            * Adding terms like `(mostly black background:1.3)`, `deep void`, `minimalist neon outlines on figure`, `subtle glowing accents`.
            * Strengthening negative prompts with terms like `(busy background:1.3)`, `cluttered`, `excessive patterns`, `overwhelming detail`.
            * Initially suggesting LoRA weights around `0.65-0.7`.
        2. **Addressing Archetypal Imagery:** The user requested more specific prompts incorporating traditional tarot symbolism (e.g., Hierophant with acolytes). A full 78-card prompt list was generated with these details, maintaining the "minimalist neon on black" aim and a default LoRA weight of `0.7`.
        3. **Diagnosing A1111 Script Input:** The user encountered issues with the "Prompts from file or textbox" script in A1111. It was discovered they were pasting the entire CSV content (including negative prompts) into the script's positive prompt box, leading to garbled instructions.
            * **Resolution:** Clarified the correct usage: create a separate `.txt` file containing *only* the positive prompts (one per line) for the script, and paste the corresponding single negative prompt into the main A1111 Negative Prompt UI box.
        4. **Revisiting LoRA Weight:** Even with corrected script input, initial results for multi-figure cards were poor (highly abstract/chaotic). This indicated the LoRA weight (`0.7`) was still too high, overpowering the base model's ability to render distinct figures.

* **Challenge 4: Image Generation Producing Pure Static/Noise**
  * **Problem:** When testing lower LoRA weights (e.g., 0.55, 0.6), image output unexpectedly became pure static. This pointed to a technical issue beyond simple prompt/weight tuning.
  * **Solution Exploration (VAE Troubleshooting):**
    * The primary suspect was the VAE (Variational Autoencoder).
    * Guided the user to check A1111 settings: **Settings > Stable Diffusion > SD VAE**.
    * The user confirmed they were using `vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned.safetensors`, which is appropriate.
    * Steps advised:
            1. Ensure the VAE was *explicitly* selected, not "Automatic."
            2. Test with SD VAE set to "None" (to use the VAE baked into the main checkpoint).
            3. Check the A1111 console for "NaN" (Not a Number) errors.
            4. Consider adding `--no-half-vae` to `COMMANDLINE_ARGS` in `webui-user.bat` if NaN errors were VAE-related.
  * **Resolution:** The VAE setting adjustment (explicit selection or "None") resolved the static issue, allowing image generation to proceed.

* **Achieving Clarity for Single Figures:**
  * With the VAE issue fixed, further iteration on LoRA weight for single-figure cards (e.g., The Emperor) showed that weights around **0.48-0.50** provided a good balance: the figure was clear and recognizable, and the blacklight neon style was applied as desired accents and outlines.
  * The issue of *duplicate figures* appearing even for single-subject prompts was addressed by:
    * Further lowering LoRA weight.
    * Adding strong anti-duplication terms to the negative prompt (e.g., `(multiple figures:1.4)`, `(duplicate figure:1.3)`).

**IV. Phase 3: Addressing Multi-Figure Card Challenges**

While single figures became manageable, multi-figure cards remained problematic.

* **Challenge 5: Continued Abstraction & Compositional Chaos for Multi-Figure Cards**
  * **Problem:** Even at lower weights that worked for single figures, multi-figure prompts (e.g., The Lovers, The Hierophant) often resulted in:
    * Indistinct, merged, or incorrectly numbered figures.
    * Chaotic compositions, diagonal movements, or images resembling multiple panels.
    * The LoRA style overwhelming the scene's legibility.
  * **Solution Exploration & Iteration:**
        1. **Initial Multi-Figure Approach:** For cards requiring multiple figures, the anti-duplication terms were removed from the negative prompt. This was necessary but not sufficient.
        2. **Lowering LoRA Weight Further (for Multi-Figures):** Tests were run with weights like `0.42`, `0.40`, and `0.38`.
            * `0.42` showed some promise in rendering multiple figures but with a significantly weakened style.
            * `0.40` and `0.38` lost too much of the LoRA's stylistic impact.
        3. **Revisiting Weight & Stronger Compositional Negatives:** The user correctly observed that results around `0.46` had previously shown potential before aggressive weight reduction. The strategy shifted to:
            * Using a slightly higher weight for multi-figure cards (e.g., target **0.46**, then tested **0.42**).
            * Keeping the *detailed positive prompts* from the master CSV.
            * Introducing a **NEW Multi-Figure Negative Prompt** that *omitted anti-duplicate terms* but *added strong terms against bad composition* (e.g., `(poor composition:1.2)`, `(chaotic composition:1.2)`, `jumbled figures`, `incoherent scene`).
        4. **Latest Test Results (Multi-Figure @ 0.46 with new negatives):** The user provided an image showing the first batch of 6 multi-figure cards. While the *number* of entities was sometimes correct, the compositions remained poor, and figures were often still abstract or jumbled. This indicated that even with the refined negative prompts, 0.46 was still allowing the LoRA to dominate the composition negatively.
        5. **Further Refinement (Prompt & Negative for Multi-Figures @ 0.46):** Based on the messy 0.46 results, the advice was to *further refine the positive prompts* for these 6 specific multi-figure cards to be more explicit about actions, poses, and desired unified composition, while keeping the strong compositional negatives and the 0.46 weight.

**V. Phase 4: Workflow Automation & Technical Optimization**

* **Development of Batch Generation & Renaming Workflow:**
  * To manage the generation of 78 cards (x4 versions each), a workflow was devised:
        1. **`batch_prompts.csv`:** A master CSV file containing `card_number`, `card_name`, `positive_prompt`, and `negative_prompt` for all 78 cards. Later, a `figure_type` ('S' or 'M') column was added to differentiate LoRA weights and negative prompt types.
        2. **A1111 "Prompts from file or textbox" script:** Used to feed positive prompts in batches.
        3. **`rename_cards.py`:** A Python script to read image files from the A1111 output directory (sorted by creation time) and rename them sequentially based on the `card_name` and `card_number` from `batch_prompts.csv` (e.g., `The_Fool_v01.png`).
        4. **`rename_cards.bat`:** A simple batch file to execute the Python script.
  * **Workflow Iteration:** Initially, the plan was to generate all multi-figure cards separately. This was corrected as it would break the sequential renaming logic. The refined workflow involves generating cards sequentially in batches, adjusting the negative prompt in the A1111 UI (and potentially the embedded LoRA weight in positive prompts) based on whether the batch contains any multi-figure cards.

* **Challenge 6: Slow Upscaling (Identified as Hires.fix Issue)**
  * **Problem:** The user reported an upscale taking 12+ minutes, suspecting CPU usage.
  * **Diagnosis:** A screenshot revealed they were using **Hires. fix** during txt2img generation with `Upscaler: Latent`, `Upscale by: 2`, and `Denoising strength: 0.7`. The extreme slowness was attributed to VRAM limitations during the high-resolution diffusion pass of Hires. fix, causing a fallback to CPU. The high denoising strength (0.7) and `Hires steps: 0` were also noted as contributing factors.
  * **Solutions Proposed for Hires. fix:**
        1. Drastically reduce `Denoising strength` (e.g., to 0.3-0.5).
        2. Try different Hires upscalers.
        3. Set `Hires steps` to a reasonable value (e.g., 15-20).
        4. Lower the `Upscale by` factor.
  * **Alternative Workflow:** Disable Hires. fix, generate at base resolution, and then use the "Extras" tab for dedicated upscaling, which often manages VRAM more effectively.

**VI. Current Status & Key Learnings (As of the end of the chat)**

* **LoRA Model:** `MysticArcanaBlacklight.safetensors` (dim=8, alpha=8) is trained and functional. It imparts a distinct blacklight neon aesthetic.
* **Single-Figure Cards:** Achievable with reasonable clarity and style using a LoRA weight of approximately **0.48**, detailed positive prompts, and a negative prompt including anti-duplication terms.
* **Multi-Figure Cards:** Significantly more challenging. The latest strategy involves:
  * LoRA weight around **0.46**.
  * Detailed positive prompts emphasizing figure clarity, action, and unified composition.
  * A specific Multi-Figure Negative Prompt that *omits anti-duplicate terms* but *includes strong terms against poor/chaotic composition*.
  * *Results for this latest strategy on the first 6 multi-figure cards were still suboptimal, indicating further refinement is needed for this category.*
* **Workflow:** A batch generation and renaming system is in place. The user understands the need to prepare batches from the master CSV and adjust A1111 settings (negative prompt, and potentially LoRA weight via editing the input .txt) for each batch.
* **Technical Issues:** VAE and Hires. fix VRAM limitations have been identified and solutions proposed.
* **LoRA Characteristics:** The current LoRA appears to have learned its style primarily from single-subject or simpler compositions. It struggles to apply this style coherently to complex multi-figure scenes without either dominating the composition negatively (at higher weights) or losing stylistic impact (at very low weights). The 21 unique training images, repeated 100 times, may have led to some overfitting on specific compositional elements or a lack of diversity for complex scenes.

**VII. Strategic Considerations & Path Forward:**

The project has made substantial progress but faces a critical juncture regarding the quality and consistency of multi-figure cards. The following strategic paths can be considered:

1. **Option A: Further Iteration on Current LoRA & Prompts (Local):**
    * **Focus:** Continue refining prompts and negative prompts for multi-figure cards, potentially testing even more granular LoRA weights (e.g., 0.44-0.47). This is the lowest-cost, immediate next step.
    * **Pros:** Leverages existing assets and workflow.
    * **Cons:** May yield diminishing returns if the LoRA's inherent limitations for multi-figure scenes are the root cause. Could be time-consuming.
    * **AI Assistant Role:** Analyze prompt structures for semantic clarity, suggest alternative phrasing for compositional control, cross-reference common Stable Diffusion prompting techniques for multi-figure coherence.

2. **Option B: Advanced Local Techniques (ControlNet):**
    * **Focus:** Introduce ControlNet (e.g., with `canny`, `openpose`, or `depth` preprocessors) to enforce compositional structure for multi-figure cards. The LoRA would then primarily apply the style.
    * **Pros:** Offers significantly more control over figure placement and pose, potentially solving the compositional chaos.
    * **Cons:** Adds complexity to the workflow, requires finding or creating suitable reference images for ControlNet for each multi-figure card.
    * **AI Assistant Role:** Identify suitable ControlNet preprocessors, advise on optimal ControlNet weight settings in conjunction with LoRA weight, potentially assist in batch processing with ControlNet if A1111 scripts allow.

3. **Option C: Explore External Generation Platforms (e.g., Civitai On-Site Generator):**
    * **Focus:** Utilize Civitai's generation service (with its subscription cost) to access a wider range of base models and community LoRAs that might be better suited for the blacklight style and/or multi-figure compositions.
    * **Pros:** Quick to test different foundational models, potentially faster generation times for individual images, might offer pre-tuned solutions.
    * **Cons:** Cost, less control over the exact LoRA used (may not be able to use `MysticArcanaBlacklight`), workflow for batching and renaming would need to be manual or adapted, upscaling still a local concern.
    * **AI Assistant Role:** Research popular blacklight/neon style LoRAs or models on Civitai, analyze their compatibility with multi-figure prompts, estimate potential generation costs based on credits.

4. **Option D: LoRA Retraining with Enhanced Dataset:**
    * **Focus:** Curate an expanded and more diverse training dataset, specifically including well-composed multi-figure examples that fit the blacklight aesthetic. Retrain the LoRA.
    * **Pros:** Addresses the likely root cause of the LoRA's limitations for multi-figure scenes. Could yield a significantly more versatile and higher-quality custom LoRA.
    * **Cons:** Most time-consuming and labor-intensive option. Requires sourcing or creating new training images.
    * **AI Assistant Role:** Advise on dataset augmentation techniques, best practices for training LoRAs for compositional diversity, analyze the existing 21 images for features that might have led to current biases.

5. **Option E: Hybrid Approach / Acceptance of Limitations:**
    * **Focus:** Use the current LoRA and workflow for single-figure cards (where it performs well). For multi-figure cards, accept a more abstract/stylized outcome, or heavily rely on cherry-picking the best of many generations, or use inpainting/editing to fix compositions.
    * **Pros:** Faster path to completing a "first version" of the deck.
    * **Cons:** Inconsistent quality across the deck, potential dissatisfaction with multi-figure card results.
    * **AI Assistant Role:** Quantify the success rate for multi-figure cards, assist in developing efficient cherry-picking or basic inpainting strategies.

**VIII. Conclusion:**

The "Mystic Arcana Blacklight" project has successfully overcome initial technical hurdles and established a foundation for generating stylized tarot cards. The LoRA effectively imparts the desired aesthetic, particularly for single-subject cards. The primary challenge lies in achieving consistent compositional clarity and stylistic coherence for multi-figure cards. The founders, with the support of their AI assistant, need to strategically decide which path (or combination of paths) offers the best balance of quality, time, and resource investment to complete the 78-card deck to their satisfaction. Addressing the local upscaling efficiency also remains a key operational step.
