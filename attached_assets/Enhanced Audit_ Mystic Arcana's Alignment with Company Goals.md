## **Enhanced Audit: Mystic Arcana's Alignment with Company Goals**

### **1\. Astrology Integration**

* **Current Status**: Astrological features are partially implemented, including birth chart calculations and zodiac-themed tarot readings.​

* **Identified Gaps**:

  * **Planetary Influence Predictions**: Lack of real-time updates on planetary movements affecting user readings.​

  * **Astrology-Tarot Synergy**: Limited integration between astrological data and tarot interpretations.​[Medium+3Etsy+3Amazon+3](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1717586030/digital-tarot-cards-set-png-tarot-card?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Recommendations**:

  * **Dynamic Astrological Updates**: Implement real-time planetary data feeds to enhance reading relevance.​

  * **Integrated Interpretations**: Develop algorithms that combine astrological transits with tarot insights for a holistic user experience.​

### **2\. Journaling and Personalization**

* **Current Status**: Basic journaling features allow users to log readings and reflections.​[Android Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en_US&id=com.lumosdesign.arcanadaily&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Identified Gaps**:

  * **Interactive Journaling**: Absence of prompts or guided questions to deepen user reflections.​

  * **Personalized Insights**: Limited customization in journaling based on user behavior and preferences.​

* **Recommendations**:

  * **Guided Journaling Prompts**: Introduce AI-generated questions tailored to individual readings to foster deeper introspection.​[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1es8zo3/we_made_a_free_tarot_reading_ai_website_with/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  * **Adaptive Personalization**: Utilize machine learning to adapt journaling features to user habits, enhancing engagement.​

### **3\. Customization and Continuous Learning**

* **Current Status**: Users can create custom tarot decks, but the system lacks adaptive learning mechanisms.​

* **Identified Gaps**:

  * **Feedback Mechanism**: No system for users to provide input on reading accuracy or relevance.​[Bon Appétit](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/desperately-seeking-certainty?srsltid=AfmBOormCysTmdqeRKFTD4l6cY3EUuYIF3pXY7jFELEB01az8ndQHQFM&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  * **Learning Algorithms**: Absence of AI models that evolve based on user interactions and feedback.​

* **Recommendations**:

  * **User Feedback Loops**: Implement features allowing users to rate and comment on readings, feeding data back into the system.​

  * **AI Model Training**: Develop machine learning models that adjust interpretations based on aggregated user feedback, enhancing accuracy over time.​

### **4\. Daily Tarot Draw Visibility**

* **Current Status**: The daily tarot draw feature is implemented but lacks prominence on the platform.​

* **Identified Gaps**:

  * **User Engagement**: Low visibility may lead to decreased user interaction with this core feature.​

* **Recommendations**:

  * **Homepage Integration**: Position the daily draw feature prominently on the homepage to encourage daily engagement.​

  * **Push Notifications**: Introduce reminders or notifications to prompt users to access their daily draw.​

### **5\. Data Sources for Machine Learning**

* **Current Status**: Limited data collection mechanisms are in place, restricting the training of robust ML models.​

* **Identified Gaps**:

  * **Diverse Data Sets**: Need for comprehensive datasets encompassing user interactions, feedback, and reading outcomes.​

* **Recommendations**:

  * **Data Collection Framework**: Establish protocols to gather anonymized user data, ensuring privacy compliance.​

  * **External Data Integration**: Incorporate external astrological and tarot databases to enrich the training material for ML models.​
