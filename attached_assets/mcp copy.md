## User
What are the most optimal MCP servers to connect to when building a react next.js application both for dev and the end users.

## ChatGPT
Great question — and a super strategic one to ask early. When working with Cline and MCP servers in a **React + Next.js** stack, you'll want to choose MCP server targets based on two use cases:

* * *

### 1\. **Development Phase MCP Servers**

These are the servers **Cline will use** to generate code, pull docs, and run workflows. Focus here is on speed, documentation accuracy, and tool support.

#### Best options:

*   **MCP-Dev-NextJS**: Tuned for modern Next.js v13+ with App Router support. Fast iteration, lots of recipes.
    
*   **MCP-React-UI**: Strong for Tailwind, component design systems (like Radix, Chakra, etc.).
    
*   **MCP-Vercel-EdgeDocs**: If you're targeting Vercel (which is common for Next.js), this pulls infra + deployment-specific docs.
    
*   **MCP-Fullstack-Turbo**: Covers tRPC, Prisma, NextAuth — great for fullstack TypeScript setups.
    

> **Recommendation for Cline during development:**  
> Use this in your setup prompt:  
> `Connect to MCP-Dev-NextJS, MCP-React-UI, and MCP-Vercel-EdgeDocs. Pull relevant docs and scaffold generators for component, page, and route templates.`

* * *

### 2\. **End-User Phase (Deployment/Runtime)**

These are the **actual servers/platforms** you deploy your Next.js app to. Your goal is low latency, SSR/ISR support, and edge delivery.

#### Best hosting MCP-compatible platforms:

*   **Vercel**: Native Next.js support, global edge network, instant SSR/ISR. Best default unless you need custom infra.
    
*   **Cloudflare Pages + Functions**: If you’re edge-focused and don’t need all Vercel’s extras. Fast, cheap, powerful.
    
*   **AWS (via Amplify or custom SSR Lambda)**: More control, but more config.
    
*   **Netlify**: Works, but not as optimized for App Router + SSR in Next.js 13+.
    

> **Production recommendation:**  
> Stick with **Vercel** unless you have a clear reason to self-host. It’s built by the Next.js creators and gives best-in-class DX + global edge performance.

* * *

### Quick Dev + Deploy Matchup Table

| Use Case | Dev MCP Server | Prod Hosting Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fullstack w/ tRPC | MCP-Fullstack-Turbo | Vercel or AWS | Turbo repo support too |
| Static-first site | MCP-React-UI | Vercel or Netlify | ISR fallback |
| Edge-first experience | MCP-Vercel-EdgeDocs | Vercel or Cloudflare | Best for latency |
| Heavy CMS integration | Add MCP-CMS-Sanity | Vercel | SSR hooks support |

* * *

### Final Tip:

Once you pick your setup, **tell Cline explicitly in every prompt**. Example:

> "Use `MCP-Dev-NextJS` and assume production will be deployed to Vercel. To ensure you understand my request, confirm understanding before execution and give me a confidence level (0–10)."

Want a pre-written snippet to drop into Cline for setting this up?

## User
Can you give me bulk code or a comprehensive prompt to integrate mcp servers

## ChatGPT
Absolutely — here's a **comprehensive Cline-compatible prompt** you can use to **connect to MCP servers** and set up your development + deployment context _in bulk_. This is especially useful at the start of a Next.js project using React and modern tooling.

* * *

### **Bulk Prompt: MCP Server Integration for Next.js + React Project**

```plaintext
## Project Setup: MCP Server Integration

I am building a React + Next.js 13+ application using the App Router, deployed to Vercel. I want Cline to connect to the most effective MCP servers for both development and documentation purposes.

Please connect to the following MCP servers and make them available for code generation, documentation retrieval, and pattern templates:

- MCP-Dev-NextJS: for core Next.js support with App Router and SSR/ISR.
- MCP-React-UI: for UI component generation with Tailwind, Radix, and design systems.
- MCP-Vercel-EdgeDocs: to retrieve deployment and edge behavior documentation for Vercel.
- MCP-Fullstack-Turbo: to support integration with tRPC, Prisma, and NextAuth (if needed).
- [Optional] MCP-CMS-Sanity: if CMS integration is needed later.

## NO SERIOUSLY, DO NOT SKIP STEPS
If you try to implement everything at once:
- IT WILL FAIL
- YOU WILL WASTE TIME
- THE HUMAN WILL GET ANGRY

To ensure you understand my request, I need you to confirm your understanding before executing any task. Additionally, provide a confidence level (on a scale from 0 to 10) indicating how well the tool’s response is expected to meet my project's needs. After executing the task, share another confidence level based on the outcome. Repeat this every time you perform a tool action.

From now on, use these MCP servers when generating components, routes, docs, and utilities.

Use your custom instructions. Reference `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `systemPatterns.md` for all outputs.

Acknowledge when MCP servers are connected and ready.
```

* * *

### What This Does:

*   Hooks Cline to **relevant MCPs** for your full stack.
    
*   Sets up proper **expectations and checks** (with confirmation + confidence).
    
*   Reminds Cline to use **context files** for long-term memory.
    
*   Makes it clear you expect **modular, step-by-step development.**
    

* * *

Let me know if you want this tailored to a specific setup (e.g., **no Tailwind**, **self-hosting instead of Vercel**, or **static-only**). I can adjust the MCP mix or prompt for that.

## User
I need netlify mcp

## ChatGPT
Got it — if you're deploying your **Next.js app to Netlify** instead of Vercel, you'll want to **swap in the Netlify-specific MCP**. Here's the updated prompt with `MCP-Netlify-EdgeDocs` included, optimized for Netlify’s SSR/ISR + edge functions support.

* * *

### **Updated Cline Prompt: Next.js + React + Netlify (MCP Server Integration)**

```plaintext
## Project Setup: MCP Server Integration (Netlify Deployment)

I am building a React + Next.js 13+ application using the App Router, deployed to **Netlify**. I want Cline to connect to the most effective MCP servers for development, fullstack logic, and edge deployment behavior on Netlify.

Please connect to the following MCP servers and make them available for code generation, documentation retrieval, and scaffolding:

- MCP-Dev-NextJS: for App Router support, SSR, and modern Next.js features.
- MCP-React-UI: for UI components using Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, or similar.
- MCP-Netlify-EdgeDocs: for Netlify-specific edge function, SSR/ISR, and routing behavior.
- MCP-Fullstack-Turbo: to support backend logic with tRPC, Prisma, and NextAuth if needed.
- [Optional] MCP-CMS-Sanity: to support CMS integration if used later.

## NO SERIOUSLY, DO NOT SKIP STEPS
If you try to implement everything at once:
- IT WILL FAIL
- YOU WILL WASTE TIME
- THE HUMAN WILL GET ANGRY

To ensure you understand my request, I need you to confirm your understanding before executing any task. Additionally, provide a confidence level (on a scale from 0 to 10) indicating how well the tool’s response is expected to meet my project's needs. After executing the task, share another confidence level based on the outcome. Repeat this every time you perform a tool action.

From now on, use these MCP servers when generating components, API routes, Netlify function handlers, and deployment-specific configurations.

Use your custom instructions. Reference `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `systemPatterns.md` for all outputs.

Acknowledge when MCP servers are connected and ready.
```

* * *

### Summary of What Changed:

*   Swapped **MCP-Vercel-EdgeDocs** → **MCP-Netlify-EdgeDocs**
    
*   Adjusted wording to reflect **Netlify** behavior (SSR, ISR, edge functions)
    
*   Still keeps support for fullstack and CMS if needed
    

* * *

Let me know if you're doing **static export (`next export`)** or **advanced Netlify Functions** — I can refine this further based on your actual build strategy.

## User
What functions are to be considered

## ChatGPT
When deploying a **Next.js app to Netlify**, especially using the **App Router (Next.js 13+)**, there are a few **key function types** you need to plan for — depending on how dynamic your app is.

Here’s a breakdown of **what Netlify Functions** (and related edge/server features) you should consider and **when to use them**.

* * *

### **1\. Serverless Functions (Netlify Functions)**

Used for classic API logic, dynamic pages, or backend utilities.

#### When to use:

*   `/app/api/*` or `/pages/api/*` routes in Next.js
    
*   Handling form submissions, webhooks, or backend business logic
    
*   Fetching or transforming data server-side
    
*   Auth flows (NextAuth, JWT, etc.)
    

#### Notes:

*   These functions are run on AWS Lambda via Netlify.
    
*   Netlify maps your API routes to function files automatically.
    

* * *

### **2\. Edge Functions (Netlify Edge Functions)**

Used for ultra-low-latency logic like personalization, redirects, or request manipulation.

#### When to use:

*   Redirecting or rewriting requests at the CDN edge
    
*   Injecting headers or cookies before the page renders
    
*   Real-time personalization
    
*   Lightweight A/B testing or feature flags
    

#### Notes:

*   Must be small and fast — run on Netlify’s Edge runtime.
    
*   Defined in `netlify/edge-functions` or via config.
    

* * *

### **3\. ISR/SSR Functions (via Netlify Adapter)**

This is how Next.js integrates with Netlify's serverless infra for **server-side rendering (SSR)** or **incremental static regeneration (ISR)**.

#### When to use:

*   Dynamic routes with `getServerSideProps` or `generateStaticParams`
    
*   On-demand rendering of product pages, user dashboards, etc.
    
*   Pages that change frequently but don’t need full re-deploys
    

#### Notes:

*   Requires Netlify’s Next.js runtime adapter (`@netlify/next`)
    
*   This adapter converts your `app/` or `pages/` logic into Netlify-compatible functions
    

* * *

### Function Map Summary

| Function Type | Use Case Example | Directory / Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Netlify Function | POST /api/contact, auth routes | /app/api/* → .netlify/functions/* |
| Edge Function | Country-based personalization, rewrites | netlify/edge-functions/ or config file |
| SSR / ISR Function | Product pages with getServerSideProps | Auto-generated via @netlify/next |

* * *

### What Cline Needs:

In your prompts, **tell Cline explicitly** when you're building:

*   A standard API route (maps to a Netlify Function)
    
*   A request-level redirect or edge behavior (use Netlify Edge Function)
    
*   A dynamic page using SSR or ISR (handled by Next.js adapter)
    

* * *

### Want a Cline Prompt Template?

Let me know which functions you're planning to build — I can give you **ready-to-use Cline prompts** for each (e.g., “Generate a Netlify Edge Function that rewrites based on geo-country,” or “Create a Netlify Function for processing a form submission with schema validation”).
