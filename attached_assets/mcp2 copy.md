## User
where's the research on the mcp servers? that was the weakest effort and non-answer i have ever received from openai. Garbage. Augment needs the server name and the command to run with arguments. roo code has this: {   "mcpServers": {        } }

## ChatGPT
I apologize for the earlier confusion and any frustration it may have caused. Let's address your requirements more precisely by detailing the configuration of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for the Augment and Roo Code extensions in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

**1\. Configuring MCP Servers in Augment**

Augment allows integration with MCP servers to enhance its capabilities. Here's how to set it up:​

*   **Using the Augment Settings Panel:**
    
    1.  Open VS Code and ensure the Augment extension is installed.​[Stack Overflow+7Posit Docs+7Reddit+7](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/vscode_sessions/extension_configuration.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    2.  Click on the gear icon in the upper right corner of the Augment panel to access the Settings Panel.​[Augment+1Augment+1](https://docs.augmentcode.com/setup-augment/mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    3.  In the MCP section, click the `+` button to add a new server.​
        
    4.  Fill in the `name` (a unique identifier for the server) and the `command` (the command to run the server, including any arguments and environment variables).​[Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/setup-augment/mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    5.  Save the configuration and restart VS Code to apply the changes.​
        
    
    _Example Configuration:_
    
    *   **Name:** `sqlite`​[Medium+4Visual Studio Marketplace+4YouTube+4](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   **Command:** `uvx mcp-server-sqlite --db-path /path/to/database.db`​[Augment+1Medium+1](https://docs.augmentcode.com/setup-augment/mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    
    This setup configures an MCP server for SQLite, specifying the path to the database. ​[MCP](https://mcp.so/server/vscode-mcp/block?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Directly Editing `settings.json`:**
    
    Alternatively, you can configure MCP servers by editing the `settings.json` file:
    
    1.  Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the Command Palette.​[Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/setup-augment/mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    2.  Type `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)` and select it.​[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SemanticWorkbenchTeam.mcp-server-vscode&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    3.  Add the MCP server configuration under the `augment.advanced` section.​[Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/setup-augment/mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    
    _Example Configuration:_
    
    ```json
    {
      "augment.advanced": {
        "mcpServers": [
          {
            "name": "sqlite",
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["mcp-server-sqlite", "--db-path", "/path/to/database.db"]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

Ensure that any required dependencies, such as `uv` and `mcp-server-sqlite`, are installed on your system. ​[Augment+1Medium+1](https://docs.augmentcode.com/setup-augment/mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**2\. Configuring MCP Servers in Roo Code**

Roo Code supports MCP server integration to extend its functionalities. Here's how to configure it:​

*   **Project-Level MCP Configuration:**
    
    Roo Code allows you to configure MCP servers on a per-project basis:​[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
    1.  Open your project in VS Code with the Roo Code extension installed.​
        
    2.  Navigate to the `.vscode` directory in your project (create it if it doesn't exist).​
        
    3.  Create or edit the `mcp.json` file within the `.vscode` directory.​[Reddit+1Visual Studio Code+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1jfr05y/try_out_mcp_servers_in_vs_code/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    4.  Define your MCP servers in this file.​
        
    
    _Example Configuration (`.vscode/mcp.json`):_
    
    ```json
    {
      "servers": {
        "google-maps": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-google-maps"],
          "env": {
            "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

This configuration sets up a Google Maps MCP server, utilizing the specified API key. ​[GitHub](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code/issues/1062?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

*   **Global MCP Configuration:**
    
    For a global configuration that applies across all projects:​[Posit Docs](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/vscode_sessions/extension_configuration.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
    1.  Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the Command Palette.​[Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/setup-augment/mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    2.  Type `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)` and select it.​
        
    3.  Add the MCP server configurations under the `mcp` section.​
        
    
    _Example Configuration:_
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcp": {
        "servers": {
          "fetch": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

This setup configures a Fetch MCP server globally. ​

After configuring the MCP servers, restart VS Code to ensure the changes take effect. If you encounter any issues, verify that all required dependencies are installed and that the paths specified in the configurations are correct.​[Augment](https://docs.augmentcode.com/setup-augment/mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate MCP servers into your React/TypeScript projects using the Augment and Roo Code extensions in VS Code, thereby enhancing your development workflow with additional tools and capabilities.​
