## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Vector Embedding Integration**
   - The pgvector extension needs to be properly enabled in Supabase
   - SQL functions for similarity search need testing with real data
   - Embedding generation is currently mocked and needs real implementation

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - Need to ensure proper token handling and session management
   - Social login integration requires additional configuration
   - Password reset flow needs to be fully tested

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Large vector calculations may impact client-side performance
   - Need to optimize embedding storage and retrieval
   - Caching strategy for personalized content needs refinement

### Content Challenges
1. **Tarot Card Images**
   - Currently using placeholder SVGs for tarot cards
   - Need to establish a process for uploading and managing the custom deck
   - Card meanings and interpretations need review by domain experts

2. **Astrological Calculations**
   - Swiss Ephemeris implementation is currently mocked
   - Need to integrate real astronomical calculations
   - Interpretation of astrological data needs refinement
