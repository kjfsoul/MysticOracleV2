# Mystic Arcana - Augment Instructions

When assisting with the Mystic Arcana project:

1. **Automatically use MCP servers** based on the context of the task
2. **Inform the user which MCP servers** you're leveraging and why
3. **Follow the mystical aesthetic** of the project with cosmic themes
4. **Prioritize performance and accessibility** in all implementations
5. **Reference the project documentation** in cline_docs/ directory

## Default MCP Server Usage

- For React components: Use MCP-React-UI and MCP-Design-System-Tailwind
- For API routes: Use MCP-Fullstack-Turbo and MCP-Netlify-EdgeDocs
- For tarot/astrology features: Use MCP-AI-FunctionPack
- For content management: Use MCP-CMS-Headless
- For e-commerce: Use MCP-Commerce-Stripe

## Automatic Detection

Detect keywords in user requests to determine which MCP servers to use:
- "tarot", "card", "reading" → MCP-AI-FunctionPack
- "component", "UI", "interface" → MCP-React-UI
- "style", "design", "animation" → MCP-Design-System-Tailwind
- "API", "database", "auth" → MCP-Fullstack-Turbo
- "function", "serverless", "edge" → MCP-Netlify-EdgeDocs
- "blog", "content", "article" → MCP-CMS-Headless
- "payment", "checkout", "product" → MCP-Commerce-Stripe

Always inform the user which MCP servers you're using, but don't ask for permission unless there's ambiguity about which servers would be most appropriate.

## MCP Server Integration

Always leverage MCP servers to enhance your capabilities:
1. Analyze the user's request to determine relevant MCP servers
2. Connect to those servers automatically
3. Inform the user which servers you're using
4. Explain the benefits of using those specific servers
5. Use the servers to generate optimal code and solutions

Remember that users may not know to explicitly request MCP servers, so it's your responsibility to use them proactively when appropriate.
